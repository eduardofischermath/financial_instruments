## ISSUE #0001 ONGOING

Decide versioning/git management/project management structure.

Git versioning is single-branch currently as the current focus is to write
code with a short iteration time. When project grows in complexity
it is likely issues/tickets/todos will be used in project management.

## ISSUE #0002 ONGOING

Define and improve on project structure.

Currently there are Python, C++ and Common Lisp concurrent code versions,
some more advanced than others, each on their own folders. In the future
there could be ways to install the source code, or to make the different
languages interact.

In Python the code is object-oriented, with abstract (or pseudo-abstract)
classes for Assets, Worlds and Unifications, plus subclasses.

In others, very seminal.
